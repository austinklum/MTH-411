{\bf Section 4 Problems}: \underline{You should be able to work out all problems}, except 20-21 and 38. However, as mentioned in lectures, you should read/study all the problems (even ones you skip), so you (i) know the statements/results contained therein, and (ii) learn how the author generates questions!

		\item[Excersise 4.2-4.6]Determine whether the binary operation $*$ gives a group structure on the given set. If no group results, give the first axiom in the order $\mathscr{G}_1,\mathscr{G}_2, \mathscr{G}_3$ from Definition 4.1 that does not hold.
			\item[4.02] Let $*$ be defined on $2\Z = \{2n|n\in \Z\}$ by letting $a * b = a + b$.
			
			Let $a,b,c \in 2\Z$.
			Consider $a*(b* c)$. \[a* (b * c) = a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c = (a* b)* c\] Therefore $*$ is associative.
			
			Consider $0 = 2\cdot 0 \in 2 \Z$. Let $a \in 2\Z$. Then \[ 0 + a = a + 0 = a\] Thus 0 is an identity element.
			
			Let $a \in 2\Z$. If $a = 2n$ for some $n\in \Z$, then $-n \in \Z$, so $-2n = -a \in 2\Z$. Observe \[a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0\]
			Thus, for all $x \in 2\Z$ there exists an inverse element.
			Therefore, because $*$ is associative, there exists an identity element, and because for all $x \in 2\Z$ there exists an inverse element, $2\Z$ closed under addition is a group.
			
			\item[4.04] Let $*$ be defined on $\Q$ by letting $a* b = ab$
				Let $ a,b,c \in \Q $. Then from associativity of multiplication.
				\[a*(b*c)=a(bc)=(ab)c=(a*b)*c\]
				Thus, $ * $ is associative under $ \Q $.
				Consider 0 in $ \Q $. As for all $ a \in \Q $
					\[0*a=0a=0\]
				Thus, there does not exist an identity element for $ \Q $.\\
				Therefore, $ \Q $ is not a group under multiplication.
			\item[4.06] Let $*$ be defined on $\C$ by letting $a* b = |ab|$
			
			\item[4.10] Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $n\in\Z = \{nm | m\in Z\}$
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Show that $ <n\Z,+> $ is a group.
				
				\item Show that $ <n\Z,+> \simeq <\Z,+>$
			\end{enumerate}
			For 4.12 and 4.18, determine whether the given set of matrices under the specified operation is a group.(additional hints in text)
			\item[4.12] All $n \times n$ diagonal matrices under matrix multiplication.
			\item[4.18] All $n \times n$ matrices with determinant either 1 or -1 under matrix multiplication.
			\item[4.26] Give a one sentence proof synopsis of the proof of the left cancellation law in Theorem 4.15
			\item[4.32] Show that every group $G$ with identity $e$ such that $x * x = e$ for all $x \in G$ is abelian.
			\item[4.33] Let $G$ be an abelian group and let $c^n = c* c * \dotsb * c $ for $n$ factors $c$, where $c\in G$ and $n \in \Z^+$. Give a mathematical induction proof that $(a * b)^n = (a^n) * (b^n)$ for all $a,b \in G$.
			\item[4.34] Let $G$ be a group with a finite number of elements. Show that for any $a \in G$, there exists an $n\in \Z^+$ such that $a^n = e$. (hints in text).
			\item[4.35] Show that if $(a  * b)^2 = a^2  * b^2$ for $a$ and $b$ in a group $G$, then $a * b = b  * a$.(text for hints). 
			\item[4.41] Let $G$ be a group and let $g$ be one fixed element of $G$. Show that the map $i_8$, such that $i_8(x) = gxg'$ for $x\in G$, is an isomorphism of $G$ with itself.
		
		\item[Ex 5.08,5.13] Determine whether the given set of inevitable $n \times  n$ matrices with real number entries is a subgroup of $GL(n,\R)$.
			\item[5.08] The $ n \times n $ matrices with determinant 2.
			\item[5.13] The set of all $n \times n$ matrices $A$ such that $(A^T)A=I_n$ (hints in text)

			\item Compute the subgroups$ <0>,<1>,<2>,<3>,<4>$ and $<5>$ of the group $\Z_6$ given part $(a)$\\
				As 0+0 =0, we have $<0> = \{0\}$.\\
				As $1+1=3,1+1+1=3,1+1+1+1=4,1+1+1+1+1=5,$ and $1+1+1+1+1+1=0$. We have$ <1> =  \{0,1,2,3,4,5\} $\\

				As $ 3+3=0 $, we have $<3> = \{0,3\} $\\
				As $ 4+4=2 $ and $ 4+4+4=0 $, we have $<4> = \{0,2,4\} $\\

		\item[Ex 5.37-5.38] Correct the definition of the italicized term without reference to the text, if correction is needed.
		\item[5.37] A \textit{subgroup} of a group $G$ is a subset $H$ of $G$ that contains the identity element $e$ of $G$ and also contains the inverse of each of its elements.\\
		A \textit{subgroup} of a group $G$ is a subset $H$ of $G$ that contains the identity element $e$ of $G$,contains the inverse of each of its elements, and is closed under the operation of $ G $.
		\item[5.38] A group $G$ is \textit{cyclic} if and only if there exists $a \in G$ such that $G = \{a^n|n\in\Z\}$.\\
		Correct as stated.
		\item[5.41] Let $\phi: G \rightarrow G'$ be an isomorphism of a group $<G, *>$ with a group $<G', *'>$
		\begin{proof}
			Let $ H $ be a subgroup of $ G $. Consider the set $ \phi[H]=\{\phi(h)|h\in H\} $. As $ \phi $ is an isomorphism and $ H \subseteq G $, we have $ \phi(h)=G' $ for some $ h\in G $. Thus, $ \phi[H] \subseteq G' $.\\
			As $ \phi $ is a isomorphism there must exist a $ \phi(e)=e' $ which gives us $ e' \in \phi[H] $.//
			Let $ x,y\in\phi[H] $. There must exist a $ h_1,h_2\in H $ such that $ x=\phi(h_1) $ and $ y=\phi(h_2) $. Then, 
				\[x*'y=\phi(h_1)*'\phi(h_2)\]
			and \[\phi(h_1*h_2)=\phi(h_1)*'\phi(h_2)\]
			Thus, $ x*'y=\phi(h_1*h_2) $\\
			Thus, $ \phi[H] $ is closed under $ *' $\\
			\\
			Let $ x\in\phi[H] $. There must exist an $ h\in H $ such that $ x=\phi(h) $. As $ H $ is a subgroup of $ G $ we have $ h^{-1}\in H $.\\
			Then, 
			\[\\phi(h)*'\phi(h^{-1}=\phi(h*h{-1})=\phi(e)=e'\].
			As,
				\[(\phi(h))^{-1}*'(\phi(h)*'\phi(h^{-1})) =(\phi(h))^{-1}*'e'=(\phi(h))^{-1}\]
			Notice.
				\[(\phi(h))^{-1}*'(\phi(h)*'\phi(h^{-1}))=((\phi(h))^{-1}*'\phi(h))*'\phi(h^{-1})=e'*'(h^{-1})=\phi(h^{-1})\]
			We have that $ \phi(h^{-1})=(\phi(h))^{-1}=x^{-1} $\\
			Thus, $ x^{-1}\in\phi[H]$.\\
			
			Therefore,$ \phi[H]$ is a subgroup of $ G' $ 
		\end{proof}
		\item[5.44] Find the flaw in the following argument: "Condition 2 of Theorem 5.14 is redundant, since it can be derived from 1 and 3, for let $a \in H$. Then $a^{-1}\in H$ by 3, and by a, $aa^{-1} = e$ is an identity element of $H$, proving 2.\\
		If $ H $ is an empty set, you can't pick any arbitrary element in $ H $. In addition, $ H $ would not contain the identity element as it's an empty set.
		\item[5.45] Show that a nonempty subset $H$ of a group $G$ is a subgroup of $G$ if and only if $ab^{-1}\in H$ for all $a,b \in H$.
		
		\item[5.52] Generalizing Exercise 51, let $S$ be any subset of a group $G$.
		
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Show that $H_s = \{x \in G|xs = sx \text{ for all} s \in S\}$ is a subgroup of $G$. 
			\item In reference to part $(a)$, the subgroup $H_G$ is the \textbf{center of} $G$. Show that $H_G$ is an abelian group.
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\item[5.54] Show that if $H \leq G$ and $K \leq G$, then $H\cap K \leq G$.
		\item[5.55] Prove that every cyclic group is abelian.
